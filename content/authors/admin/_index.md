I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Alexa AI. I work on Conversational AI and help improve social conversational skills of Alexa. My research experience spans natural language understanding (analyzing sentiments, emotions, and affect in conversations) and generation (efficient controllability).  

I completed my PhD in National University of Singpaore.
